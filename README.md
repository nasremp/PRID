# PRID

This repository has made for Zewail City Internship at Summer 2022. We were working on Zewail City Survielience system. We were part of people analytics team who is responisble for person re-identification techniques. You Will find some notebooks of some trials that may help you to understand and be familier with torch-reid.

## The main final work are in thoose files:

1) Classify_Data_Final.ipynb : This is a python script that can convert Zewail city dataset into an approirate form of train, test, and query folders, which can be able to register in torchreid.

2) Best_Osnet.ipynb: This notebook is applying Osnet_X1_0 pre-traind model on market1501 and fine-tuned it on zewail city dataset.

3) intern_single_query.ipynb: This notebook working inside torchreid to allow it to be able to accept single query image and search for its best match of it in test "gallery" dataset.
